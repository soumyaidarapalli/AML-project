# Movie Ranking and Recommendations System

This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and viewing patterns and demonstrates the implementation of multiple recommendation algorithms, providing insights into collaborative filtering techniques for improving user experience through personalized suggestions.

# performed :
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand user preferences and movie ratings.

# Recommendation Models Implemented:
User-Based Collaborative Filtering - Recommends movies based on similar user preferences.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering - Suggests movies with similar attributes or viewing patterns.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Utilizes matrix factorization to predict user-movie interactions.
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): Factorizes the user-item matrix to generate recommendations.
# Surprise Library Integration:
Leveraged the Surprise library for building and evaluating collaborative filtering models efficiently.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Surprise
Machine Learning Techniques: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization
Results
Model evaluations were conducted using RMSE, MAE, and precision-recall metrics.
Recommendations generated through various techniques were compared to optimize performance.
